In the Android project, the "res" folder consists of a few sub-folders that are responsible for each of the resources such as layout and menu.

In particular, there may be more than one layout folder that determine the size groups, such example would be "layout-large" folder. Although it is not a must to explicitly declare in the manifest file, Android system is able to auto-detect the device's screen size and find the most appropriate layout folder to present the view.
